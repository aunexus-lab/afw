# 05 — Glossary

**Shared Vocabulary for the AFW Project**

---

## Academic Terms

**Academic Artifact**
A tangible piece of evidence produced by a student (e.g., explanation, analysis, report) that demonstrates reasoning, not just execution.

**Applied AI System**
An AI-enabled system designed to support real-world decision-making, integrating data, models, workflows, and governance considerations.

**Auditability**
The ability to trace how a decision or recommendation was produced, including data sources, transformations, and reasoning steps.

**Capability**
A type of academic thinking or practice that students develop over time (e.g., reasoning, modeling, ethical analysis).

**Context**
Relevant historical, relational, or behavioral information that gives meaning to an event beyond its raw representation.

**Decision Recommendation**
A reasoned output produced by the system that suggests an interpretation or course of action without enforcing execution.

**Evidence**
Documented justification that supports claims, decisions, or conclusions within the system.

## System & Architecture Terms

**Action**
An optional downstream response triggered by a recommendation. AFW separates recommendations from actions.

**Architecture**
The structured organization of system components and their responsibilities, designed to support reasoning and traceability.

**Context Enrichment**
The process of augmenting an event with historical, relational, or derived data to support informed reasoning.

**Decision Layer**
The stage where model outputs and system logic are combined into a recommendation.

**Event**
A structured representation of an occurrence derived from one or more raw log entries.

**Feature**
A structured attribute derived from an enriched event, used as input for analysis or modeling.

**Ingestion**
The process of collecting raw logs without interpretation.

**Normalization**
The transformation of heterogeneous logs into a consistent event format.

**Pipeline**
The ordered sequence of processing stages that transform raw logs into decision recommendations.

## Machine Learning Terms (AFW Context)

**Model**
A statistical or machine learning component that evaluates features and produces an assessment. In AFW, the model is a component, not the system.

**Inference**
The process of applying a trained model to an event to produce an output.

**Training**
The process of fitting a model to historical data.

**Uncertainty**
The degree of confidence or probability associated with a model’s output.

---

## Governance & Ethics Terms

**Explainability**
The ability to understand and articulate why a system produced a particular recommendation.

**Governance**
The policies, controls, and oversight mechanisms that ensure responsible system behavior.

**Human Oversight**
The principle that humans retain responsibility for interpreting and acting on system recommendations.

**Tradeoff**
A deliberate choice between competing objectives (e.g., speed vs. explainability).

---

## Educational Terms (AFW Usage)

**Case Study Mode**
Using AFW as a system to explain, critique, or analyze without modifying it.

**Design Exercise**
An activity where students propose or justify changes to part of the system.

**Learning Depth**
The level of maturity at which a student engages with the system, from understanding to integration.

**System Reasoning**
The ability to explain how components interact and why they are organized as they are.

## What This Glossary Is For

This glossary exists to:

* align language across courses
* reduce ambiguity in assignments
* support consistent evaluation
* reinforce system-level thinking

If a term is unclear in an assignment or discussion,
**refer back to this glossary before introducing new terminology**.
