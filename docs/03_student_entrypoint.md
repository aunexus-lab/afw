# 03 — Student Entry Point

**How to Approach the AFW Project**

---

## 1. Read This First

If you are a student encountering AFW for the first time, this document explains **how to approach the project**, not how to “complete” it.

AFW is **not** a typical assignment.

You are not expected to:

* understand the entire system at once
* implement everything yourself
* optimize for performance or completeness

You are expected to **reason, explain, and justify**.

---

## 2. What AFW Is (From a Student Perspective)

AFW is a **shared applied AI system** used across the MSAI program.

You will interact with it:

* in different courses
* at different depths
* with different academic goals

Sometimes you will:

* analyze part of the system
* redesign a component
* evaluate model behavior
* reflect on ethical implications

Sometimes you will only **observe and explain**.

All of these are valid interactions.

---

## 3. The Correct Way to Start

Do **not** start by running code.

Start by understanding:

1. **The problem AFW addresses**
   (`docs/00_problem_context.md`)

2. **The conceptual solution**
   (`docs/01_proposed_solution.md`)

3. **The system architecture and rationale**
   (`docs/02_system_architecture.md`)

This order is intentional.

## 4. How to Navigate the Repository

Use this mental model:

* `/docs`
  → Understanding the problem and the system

* `/core`
  → How the system is implemented

* `/scripts`
  → How the system operates

* `/nexus`
  → How learning and evidence are structured

If you feel lost, return to `/docs`.

---

## 5. What You Are Expected to Produce

Your primary outputs are **academic artifacts**, not code alone.

Depending on the course, you may be asked to produce:

* written explanations
* architectural justifications
* model evaluation reports
* comparative analyses
* ethical or governance reflections

Code may support these artifacts, but **code is not sufficient by itself**.

---

## 6. What You Are *Not* Being Asked to Do

You are not being asked to:

* build a production system
* solve cybersecurity as a domain
* compete on model accuracy
* master every tool used in the project

AFW is a **learning environment**, not a performance contest.

---

## 7. How Your Work Will Be Evaluated

Faculty will evaluate:

* clarity of reasoning
* quality of explanation
* justification of decisions
* awareness of tradeoffs
* quality of evidence

Grades are based on **how well you think**, not how complex your code is.

---

## 8. How AFW Fits Across the Program

You may encounter AFW:

* early in the program as a system to understand
* later as a system to analyze or redesign
* near the end as a system to present holistically

Each interaction builds on the previous one.

You are not expected to repeat work;
you are expected to **deepen your understanding**.

---

## 9. If You Feel Stuck

If you are unsure what to do next:

1. Re-read the problem context
2. Ask yourself:

   * *What decision is this system trying to support?*
   * *What information is missing?*
   * *What assumptions are being made?*
3. Discuss your reasoning, not just your results

Confusion is normal.
Unexamined assumptions are not.

---

## 10. Final Guidance

AFW rewards:

* thoughtful analysis
* clear communication
* justified decisions

It does not reward:

* blind implementation
* unnecessary complexity
* tool obsession

If you can explain **why** the system behaves the way it does,
you are doing the project correctly.

📄 **Next (when instructed by your course):**
Explore the `/nexus` folder to understand how your work maps to academic capabilities and assessment.
