# 04 — Faculty Usage Guide

**Using AFW as an Academic System**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Guide

This document explains **how faculty should use AFW** within courses of the Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence (MSAI).

AFW is designed to:

* support multiple courses
* enable different learning depths
* preserve academic coherence across the program

AFW is **not** a fixed assignment or a prescribed syllabus.

---

## 2. What AFW Is (From a Faculty Perspective)

AFW is a **shared applied AI system** that functions as:

* a reference system
* a reasoning environment
* a source of academic artifacts

Faculty are not expected to:

* teach every component of AFW
* cover the entire system
* align their course entirely around it

Faculty are expected to **selectively engage** with AFW where it reinforces course objectives.

---

## 3. How to Introduce AFW in a Course

Faculty should introduce AFW by framing:

1. **The problem context**
   What decision-making challenge is being addressed?

2. **The system perspective**
   How does AFW approach this problem?

3. **The course connection**
   Which part of the system is relevant *in this course*?

AFW should be presented as:

> *“One system we will use to reason about AI concepts.”*

Not as:

> *“The project you must fully implement.”*

---

## 4. Recommended Modes of Use

AFW can be used in several ways.

### 4.1 As a Case Study

* Students explain or critique a component
* Focus on reasoning, not implementation

### 4.2 As an Analysis Target

* Students evaluate data, models, or decisions
* Focus on interpretation and tradeoffs

### 4.3 As a Design Exercise

* Students redesign part of the pipeline
* Focus on justification and constraints

### 4.4 As a Capstone System

* Students integrate and present the system
* Focus on coherence and evidence

Faculty may choose **one or more modes**, depending on course level.

---

## 5. What Faculty Should Evaluate

Faculty should evaluate:

* clarity of reasoning
* quality of explanations
* justification of design choices
* awareness of system-level tradeoffs
* quality of academic evidence

Faculty should **not** evaluate:

* tool sophistication
* code volume
* production readiness

---

## 6. Aligning AFW with Course Objectives

Faculty should map:

* course learning outcomes
  to
* specific AFW layers or decisions

Examples:

* A modeling course → focus on feature representation and evaluation
* A data course → focus on context enrichment and data contracts
* An ethics course → focus on decision boundaries and governance

AFW supports **partial and selective alignment**.

---

## 7. Using AFW with Academic Frameworks

AFW is intentionally designed to integrate with Atlantis Nexus **after** context and architecture are understood.

Faculty should:

* introduce Nexus as an organizing lens
* not as the starting point
* not as an additional burden

Nexus helps clarify:

* what capability is being developed
* what evidence should be produced

---

## 8. Artifact-Centered Assessment

Faculty are encouraged to assess **artifacts**, not activities.

Examples:

* explanation documents
* model evaluation reports
* architectural decision records
* ethical analyses

Artifacts should be:

* clear
* justified
* defensible

---

## 9. Faculty Autonomy and Governance

AFW preserves faculty autonomy by:

* not prescribing tools
* not enforcing full-system coverage
* supporting different pedagogical approaches

At the same time, AFW provides:

* shared context
* consistent academic signaling
* program-level coherence

---

## 10. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

* Treating AFW as a coding assignment
* Expecting full-system implementation
* Evaluating complexity instead of reasoning
* Introducing Nexus before context

AFW works best when **simplicity and clarity are prioritized**.

---

## 11. Final Guidance for Faculty

AFW is a **means**, not an end.

Its value lies in:

* enabling structured reasoning
* supporting meaningful assessment
* connecting courses through a shared system

If students can clearly explain **why** a decision is made,
AFW has served its purpose.
